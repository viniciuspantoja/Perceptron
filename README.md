# Perceptron
MIT Deep Learning module. 

I've incremented the model presented on course to define decision boundaries based on a Perceptron algorithm.

The goal is to present how the decision boundary is formated based on a perceptron algorithm. To make it clear, it was created a database of 13 points, that are ploted on a scatter plot based on its size and weight. This first database was created to make the points separated from each other, leading to a perfect separation of the perceptron algorithm. We plot the forcast x the observed values, and the confusion matrix. 

On a second step we introduce another point into this database, that leads to a not perfect fitting of the model once again we plot the decision boundaries and confusion matrix. 

The third step we add another point into the database that leads to a big misclassification of the model. 


There are three files, one class file that is our perceptron model, another file that defines our plot functions, and the main script. the three files should be in the same directory.

Our perceptron model (that holds for larger datasets) is fitted into this data, and then we plot the decision boundary
